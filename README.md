## Important Notice:

I do not take responsibility for anything, including but not limited to:
Violating operator laws, bricking your modem, your local laws, any harm or loss
caused by using the provided script. Read the GPL license provided with the
script.

### TL;DR How to fix the modem? (run the script)

Run the provided script on a linux or Mac (not tested) connected to the modem
and it will de-suck the modem. The script is automation of some telnet
commands.<br>
It requires that you install `expect` and `telnet` on your machine.

You wont have connection drops, very high ping time, connection hanging and...
anymore.

### What's wrong with it anyway?

ZTE modem operates terribly in IPv6 mode (aka, it sucks beyong your
imagination).  Even if you disable IPv6 mode in connecting devices, it still
sucks. You can disable IPv6 on the modem using the provided script.

Disabling IPv6 on the modem, ping time (of an (almost) near servers) is reduced
from 120 - 170ms to 50 - 55ms. Connection are not dropped anymore. And many
many other issues are simply resolved.


## ======== Further Details ==========

TODO: Totally kill and destroy and abolish the tr069 service running on the modem.
:middle_finger

My modem is originally locked by the operator (MTN-Irancell). I don't know if
there is a problem with the operator handling IPv6 or the modem itself. In
anycase, it works just fine using IPv4 only.

The printed version on back of my modem is Irancell-MF810, there are no signs
of ZTE anywhere. Looking at the source code of admin page, you can see ZTE
copyright phrase commented out. A text file `/etc/version` says the modem
version (ZTE/zx297520) a little birdy said it is same as MF903 (I googled
actually).

#### Is it possible to unlock the modem?

Probably, flashing an unlocked firmware should do it. I don't know if the
binary firmware is available anywhere but there is a link to ZTE-Opensource,
and it contains source code for compiling firmware of some of their modems.
Today I looked again, there was no such thing anymore. At least for MF903.

### ========= Technical Details Or, Let Me In ==========

credentials: root:*anything* OR admin:admin<br>
command: `telnet 192.168.1.1 4719 -ladmin`

`ladmin` option **MUST** be provided otherwise telnet will just hang or wont
login.<br>
If telnet fails, use nc (netcat) but it's not as good connecting to telnetd.

## You may find these things interesting:

- It runs [uclinux](http://www.uclinux.org/), The Embedded
  Linux/Microcontroller Project.

- Bonus tip: the easiest way to transfer files from modem is to copy the, to
  web server directory and download it as a regular file from port 80.

- Fun fact: you can control LED's on the device, go to `/sys/class/leds` and
  echo 0 or 1 to 'bat_red/brightness' or any other led.

- Does it come with GPIO? yes. But I don't know what do they control and where
  is the pinout. Also there are i2c, many uart and... Find them in `/sys/class`

- A goahead server is running on port 80, it's a single binary, HTTP POST/GET
  is handled by some other binary file, the binary was in `/mnt/jffs2` I guess.
  Maybe `/etc_ro/cgi-bin/upload.cgi`. I don't know if it is possible to find out
  how to unlock the modem using this file.

- You will find many scripts in `/mnt/jffs2/scripts/zte_get_LanEnable.sh` I
  have added a few of my own. The directory is writable.

- A program called `nv` configures the modem. It's a binary.
```
~ # nv
usage: cfg [get name] [set name=value] [unset name] [show] [erase] [save] [restore]
``` 

- Parts of `/etc/rc` file
```
mount -t jffs2 mtd:jffs2 /mnt/jffs2
mount -t jffs2 mtd:yaffs /mnt/yaffs
#mount -t jffs2 mtd:fotaupdate /cache
...
